        "goal": "The National Knowledge Center on the History and Heritage of Jerusalem and its Environs seeks to integrate the archaeological and historical information on Jerusalem, by creating a platform that will enable an integrative spatial and temporal presentation of data from different sources.",
        "platform": "The platform will allow access, through various layers of maps, to information on the results of excavations and surveys carried out in Jerusalem over the last 150 years or so, as well as to historical and literary information from textual sources, and will include links to landmarks and sites in the city map, and points across the diachronic axis. The platform will include links between different entities, such as people and events, and will allow navigation between threads of information, crisscrossing through different types of data relations, and will integrate them into a comprehensive historical picture. This will enable various temporal and spatial sections through, inter alia, a Geographic Information System.",

        "Settled": "Settled continuously for millennia, holy to the three monotheistic religions, and located at the center of world attention today, Jerusalem's importance cannot be overestimated. As fitting such an important city, Jerusalem is also one of the most documented sites in the world. Numerous texts of all types, of diverse origins, languages and nature, cite the city, and provide information about its history, population, demography and culture over almost 4,000 years. This has been and is accompanied by dozens of planned excavations, hundreds of salvage excavations and extensive archaeological surveys, all supplying the academic community with unparalleled information on the city and its environment.",
